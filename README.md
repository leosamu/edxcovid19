# I don't care i want to use it for my organization!

  

If you want to use it for your organization you will need a mysql server with 2 tables. And a nodejs server just that.

###  1. For the tables creation at the mysql server you'll need to run:

    CREATE TABLE `solicitudes` (  
    `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  
    `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,  
    `licencia` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,  
    `fecha` date NOT NULL,  
    `enviada` date DEFAULT NULL,  
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)  
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=211 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
    CREATE TABLE `licencias` (  
    `idlicencias` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  
    `plataforma` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,  
    `licencia` varchar(45) NOT NULL,  
    `url` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,  
    `entregada` tinyint(4) DEFAULT NULL,  
    PRIMARY KEY (`idlicencias`),  
    UNIQUE KEY `plataforma` (`plataforma`,`licencia`)  
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=7009 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

My apologies for the column names when i generated the tables did not expect this to go public ^^ feel free to translate them but if you do so you'll need to change the querys aswell.

###  2. Configure the connection to the mysql server at config/database_conf.js

    const pool = mysql.createPool({    
	    connectionLimit:  1000,    
	    password:  'yourpassword',    
	    user:  'youruser',    
	    database:'licences',    
	    host:'localhost',    
	    port:'3306'    
    });



### 3. Change the mail filter and messages
Ok this is prolly not the most elegant way to do things but you can change the mail configuration at config/email.js.

here you can switch the allowed domain to request licences and the message that the users will receive.

### 4. change the user messages:
Like before i created at config/lang_conf.js a file with the popup messages the user will receive change it there.

### 5. change the task_rest urls:

Ok there are 2 tasks that every 15 mins will check if there are new requests and will asign licences if there are avaiable and send messages you will need to set the valid route at config/task_rest.js

And thats the last configuration step
 
 ### 6. Once you have all configured install de node app with

     npm install

 ### 7. Then launch the webserver  

    npm start

Tthis will launch the server at ./bin/www and start to listen at the port 3000

### 6. I have a server running and an empty database what now?

OKOK calm down, edX surelly sent you or your organization a csv file with the licences right? put that file at **/edxlicences/new** and then you have 2 options wait for a magic creature (crontask) to upload them to the mysql or you can just visit **http://yourhost/licences/load** this will launch a process that loads the csv file into the mysql and then moves the file from new to processed.
